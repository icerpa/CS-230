# CS-230 Software Design Document Reflection


# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. 

The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based version of their game, Draw It or Lose It. Currently available only as an Android app, Draw It or Lose It is a competitive drawing game where teams compete to guess what image is being rendered from a library of stock images. The Gaming Room has specified that the game application be multi-team capable, have multiple players per team, allow unique game and team names, and that a single instance of the game exists in memory.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think that I did a good job in summarizing the main points throughout the documentation. I think that I was most thorough in the evaluation section where I went into more detail on they types of resources available on each platform. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I think that the Requirements, Design Constraints, and Domain Model sections were most helpful to keep in mind when developing the code. Prior to this course, I didn't outline and go into detail like I did with this documentation and I can really see the benefit in doing so now. It really helped me see where I would run into challenges when coding and start thinking more "big picture" with my coding and organization. I was also reminded of how important and useful the UML diagram is.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think that I would choose the requirements section to edit. I would include in the requirements the fact that the application will be using a library of 200 high-definition images and so sufficient and appropriate storage and that caching will need to be implemented so that the images render quickly.


# How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

While keeping in mind the requirements and needs of The Gaming Room and the design of Draw It or Lose It, it's important to also consider the user that will interact with the software. Since this game aims to be multi-platform, consideration has to be given to how the user experience will be maintained regardless of the platform they are using. So when making choices about software design for the client, you also need to think about how these choices will affect the user experience and make sure the choice is beneficial for both.

# How did you approach designing sofware? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design similar software application?

Working on a sofware design document really helped me focus and weigh every decision I was making throughout the process. When beginning a coding project, I'm usually so excited to get to work on my implementation that I sometimes forget to take a pause and look at the "big picture" of my coding project. With this software design document project, I really learned how important and how helpful breaking down a coding project is. This is something I will definitely incorporate in my coding from now on.
